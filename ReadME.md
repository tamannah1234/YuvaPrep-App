## 📂 Module Details

---

### ⛳ Frontend  
Location: `client/`

React application with:
- Login
- Candidate dashboard
- Question attempt interface
- Score & feedback UI
- Protected routes (Firebase Auth)

---

### 🔐 Backend  
Location: `server/`

Node.js + Express server handles:
- Route management
- MySQL connection
- Auth verification (Firebase token)
- Data storage (sessions, scores, questions)
- Orchestrates calls to Python ML services

---

### 🤖 Question Generation Service  
Location: `QuestionGeneration/backend/app/`

Responsible for generating interview questions and basic evaluation logic.

Models used:
- `google/flan-t5-small` (question & answer generation)
- SentenceTransformers for similarity
- DistilBERT for sentiment
- DistilBART for feedback

---

### 🧠 Evaluation / ML Service  
Location: `evaluation/ml_service`

Responsible for evaluating candidate answers and audio transcription.

Models used:
- `SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")` — semantic similarity
- Whisper (speech-to-text)
- GROQ LLM for ideal answer generation

---

## 📏 Scoring Logic (0–10 Scale)

Evaluation is based on three metrics:

| Metric | Purpose | Weight |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Semantic Similarity | Concept alignment with ideal answer | 60% |
| Keyword Coverage | Role keyword matches | 25% |
| Sentiment Confidence | Positive tone / clarity | 15% |

### How Final Score is Calculated

1. Compute hybrid weighted score:

```python
final = 0.6 * similarity + 0.25 * coverage + 0.15 * sentiment

Convert to 0–10 scale:

final_score = round(final * 10, 2)

Example:

0.78 → 7.8 / 10

Feedback is generated by summarization models based on question + answer + reference answer.
